[![Breadbox.io](http://i.imgur.com/vAw3l8H.png)](http://breadbox.io)

The mainsite for BreadBox.io using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js & Node Package Manager
You'll need to download and install Node.js version 6 or higher and Node Package Manager for installing dependencies.  Node Package Manager is installed when installing Node.js.  Download the latest version of Node.js for [macOS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.11.0/node-v6.11.0.pkg) or [Windows (64-bit)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.11.0/node-v6.11.0-x86.msi).

### Installing

First, you'll need to clone this repo to your working directory on your local machine.  Second, install the project dependencies using Node Package Manager through the command line.

#### Installing Dependencies

1. Open your command line.
2. Navigate to your working directory.
3. Clone this repo to your working directory.
4. Navigate inside the breadboxio-mainsite directory.
5. Install the dependencies.

```
cd /path/to/working/directory
git clone https://github.com/BreadboxIO/breadboxio-mainsite
cd /breadbox-mainsite
npm install
```

## Development

During development you can start the app using `npm run start`.  This will begin running the app at a specificed local server (typically [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/)).  You can then view the app in any web browser or browser simulator.  Any time you make a change to the `src` folder while the app is running, the app will automatically update in your browser.

```
npm run start
```

## Deployment

After completing development you can run `npm run build`.  This will minifiy and compile the `src` folder into a `public` folder.  The contents of the `public` folder is used for publishing as the [GitHub Pages site](https://github.com/BreadboxIO/breadboxio.github.io).

Once the build task is complete, commit and push the contents of the `public` folder to the [breadboxio.github.io](https://github.com/BreadboxIO/breadboxio.github.io) repository on the `master` branch.  This will automatically update the mainsite at [breadbox.io](http://breadbox.io).

```
npm run build
```
